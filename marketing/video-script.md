# Scenery Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)

**VOICEOVER:**
"With AI tools like Google AI Studio, you can vibe-code an entire app in seconds. But the second someone asks for a demo video, you're back to screen recording, editing frame by frame, and doing it all over again every time you change the UI. That's why I built Scenery. Connect your GitHub repo, and Gemini turns your components into polished demo videos—videos that actually stay in sync with your code. No re-recording. No re-editing. Automatic."

**MOTION GRAPHICS:**
```
0:00-0:05
- Black screen, text types in: "You can build an app in an afternoon"
- Show logos fading in: Google AI Studio, Claude, Cursor
- Bright, optimistic feeling

0:05-0:10
- Record scratch / tone shift
- Screen recording UI appears (OBS-style)
- Red "REC" indicator blinking
- Timeline with clips, cuts, frustration

0:10-0:20
- Transition: recording UI shatters/dissolves
- Scenery logo animates in (clean, confident)
- Tagline fades in below: "Videos that sync with your code"
```

## DEMO WALKTHROUGH

### Connect Repo (0:20 - 0:35)

**VOICEOVER:**
"Here's how it works. I connect a GitHub repo—a real component library I built. Scenery discovers every React component, analyzes the props, and generates live previews. All powered by Gemini."

**SCREEN RECORDING:**
```
[Show: GitHub connection flow]
- Click "Connect GitHub"
- OAuth popup appears briefly
- Repo list loads
- Select repo
- Loading spinner: "Discovering components..."
- Component grid populates with cards (staggered animation)
- Counter: "47 components found"
```

---

### Component Discovery (0:35 - 1:00)

**VOICEOVER:**
"Each component gets categorized, realistic demo props, and a live preview—all AI-generated. If your repo has Storybook stories, Scenery extracts those props for even higher quality. Three-tier approach: Storybook first, then AI-generated, then type-based defaults."

**SCREEN RECORDING:**
```
[Show: Component detail panel]
- Click on a Button component
- Side panel slides in showing:
  - Component name + category badge
  - Props table with types
  - Live preview rendering
- Hover over "AI Generated" badge
- Tooltip: "Props generated by Gemini 3"
- Click another component (DataTable)
- Show more complex preview with sample data
```

---

### Create Video (1:00 - 1:30)

**VOICEOVER:**
"Now here's where it gets interesting. I select a few components and ask Gemini to create a video. Behind the scenes, three AI agents coordinate: a Director plans the narrative, a Scene Planner designs animations and cursor interactions, and a Refinement Agent scores the result and iterates until it hits the quality threshold."

**SCREEN RECORDING:**
```
[Show: Video generation flow]
- Shift-click to multi-select 4-5 components
- Selected components highlight with checkmarks
- Click "Generate Video" button
- Modal appears: "Describe your video..."
- Type: "Create a walkthrough showing our form components"
- Click Generate
- Progress indicator with stages:
  - "Director planning narrative..."
  - "Scene Planner designing animations..."
  - "Rendering scenes..."
  - "Refinement Agent scoring..."
- Video player appears with generated result
```

---

### AI Chat Refinement (1:30 - 2:00)

**VOICEOVER:**
"But the real magic is iterative refinement. Most AI tools give you one shot—if it's wrong, start over. With Scenery, I just chat. 'Slow down the transitions.' 'Add emphasis on the button click.' The AI adjusts the video in real-time. No starting over. No manual editing."

**SCREEN RECORDING:**
```
[Show: Chat-based refinement]
- Video player on left, chat panel on right
- Type: "Slow down the transitions between components"
- AI responds: "Adjusting transition timing..."
- Video updates (show before/after if possible)
- Type: "Add a hover effect before clicking the submit button"
- AI responds: "Adding cursor hover animation..."
- Video updates with new hover effect
- Emphasize: changes happen WITHOUT re-generating from scratch
```

---

### Auto-Updating (2:00 - 2:30)

**VOICEOVER:**
"And here's the killer feature: push an update to your repo, and previews regenerate automatically. Videos stay current with code. Documentation that never goes stale."

**SCREEN RECORDING:**
```
[Show: Sync flow]
- Terminal window: git push
- Scenery dashboard
- "Sync" button or webhook notification appears
- Components refresh with new previews
- Show a component that changed (before/after)
- Video timeline updates to reflect new component
- Badge: "Last synced: just now"
```

---

## CLOSE (2:30 - 3:00)

**VOICEOVER:**
"Under the hood, Scenery combines seven distinct Gemini integrations with Remotion—the React video framework—for frame-perfect rendering. Compositions are real React components, exported to MP4 via AWS Lambda in seconds. It's not AI bolted on. It's AI and professional video tooling, all the way down."

"If you're building with React and tired of demo videos going stale the moment you ship—Scenery fixes that. Connect your repo, let Gemini do the work, and get videos that actually stay in sync with your code."

"Thanks for watching."

**MOTION GRAPHICS:**
```
2:30-2:45
- Pull back from screen recording
- Show tech stack icons animating in:
  - Gemini 3 Pro (center, largest)
  - Remotion logo (video engine)
  - AWS Lambda (serverless rendering)
  - Fly.io (cloud hosting)
  - Supabase (database)
- Show 7 Gemini integration nodes connecting:
  1. Component Discovery
  2. Props Generation
  3. Preview Rendering
  4. Director Agent
  5. Scene Planner
  6. Refinement Agent
  7. TTS Voiceover
- Lines connect them showing data flow
- Text: "AI + Remotion = Videos that scale"

2:45-3:00
- Fade to clean black
- Scenery logo centered
- Below: "Built with Gemini 3 + Remotion"
- CTA button animates in: "Connect Your Repo"
- Subtle glow/pulse on CTA
- Hold for 3 seconds
```
